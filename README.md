## FIND ME A DOC!

  The idea of this website is to find the nearest doctor based on the input for your zipcode entered. The zipcode will pull from an API that lists the closest doctor that is still accepting new patients. The API will then lists all the doctors onto a map. There is a limit cap of ten miles on the search radius. Every search inquery will bring up ten results.
